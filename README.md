# Meta-Learning Optimisation for Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI)

This repository contains the implementation of my MSc Individual Research Project at Imperial College London.

## 📌 Overview

Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is a powerful technique for reconstructing high-resolution acoustic velocity models from wavefield data. However, it is computationally expensive and highly non-convex.

This project explores **meta-learning optimisation strategies** for FWI, where the goal is to learn improved update rules instead of hand-designing optimisation algorithms.

The approach combines:

* Differentiable physics (forward and adjoint wave solvers)
* Learned optimisation methods
* Gradient-based inverse problem frameworks

## 🎯 Objectives

* Develop a differentiable FWI pipeline using JAX
* Design a meta-learned optimiser for iterative reconstruction
* Compare learned optimisation against classical methods (e.g. SGD, Adam, L-BFGS)
* Evaluate convergence speed, reconstruction quality, and robustness

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python
* JAX
* NumPy / SciPy
* Matplotlib

## 📂 Repository Structure (Planned)
