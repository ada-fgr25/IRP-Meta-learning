# Meta-Learning Optimisation for Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI)

This repository contains the implementation of my MSc Individual Research Project at Imperial College London.

## 📌 Overview

Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is a powerful technique for reconstructing high-resolution acoustic velocity models from wavefield data. However, it is computationally expensive and highly non-convex.

This project explores **meta-learning optimisation strategies** for FWI, where the goal is to learn improved update rules instead of hand-designing optimisation algorithms.

The approach combines:

* Differentiable physics (forward and adjoint wave solvers)
* Learned optimisation methods
* Gradient-based inverse problem frameworks

## 🎯 Objectives

* Develop a differentiable FWI pipeline using JAX
* Design a meta-learned optimiser for iterative reconstruction
* Compare learned optimisation against classical methods (e.g. SGD, Adam, L-BFGS)
* Evaluate convergence speed, reconstruction quality, and robustness

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python
* JAX
* NumPy / SciPy
* Matplotlib

## 🚀 Research Roadmap

The project will be developed progressively, starting from simple and interpretable baselines towards more advanced learned optimisation strategies.

### Phase 1 — Classical FWI Baseline

* Implement differentiable FWI with forward and adjoint solvers
* Optimisation using standard methods (SGD, Adam, L-BFGS)
* Establish baseline performance and evaluation metrics

### Phase 2 — Meta-Learned Scalar Optimisation

* Learn global optimisation hyperparameters (learning rate, momentum)
* Explore time-dependent or piecewise schedules
* Compare against classical optimisers

### Phase 3 — Spatially Adaptive Updates

* Learn spatially varying step sizes (diagonal preconditioning)
* Introduce simple learned mappings from gradients to updates

### Phase 4 — Learned Update Operators

* Parameterise update rules using neural networks (e.g. CNNs)
* Incorporate gradient history and optimisation state
* Study stability and generalisation

### Phase 5 — Geometry-Aware Optimisation

* Explore structured update rules inspired by non-Euclidean optimisation
* Investigate connections to Bregman distances and learned metrics

### Phase 6 — Uncertainty-Aware Optimisation (Exploratory)

* Model uncertainty in update steps (stochastic optimisation)
* Investigate its role in exploration vs refinement
* Explore uncertainty-based stopping criteria

### Phase 7 — Evaluation and Analysis

* Benchmark across synthetic datasets
* Analyse convergence behaviour and robustness
* Study generalisation across different problem instances
